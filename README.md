# GroupProject1
first group project
###“How many of you get tired of your monotonous routine and feel like you need to get out for an evening, but you’re not exactly sure what you want to do? 
* You want to break out of you comfort zone of sitting at your local dive bar you frequently visit - and go experience something new?”
* The name of our project - EasyEvening
* The common problem that people have when they want to have a fun night out - “what should we do tonight? Idk”
* A lot of the time, even if we live in a city for years on end - we often find ourselves sitting on the couch around 5-6pm on a Friday or Saturday not sure what to entertain ourselves with for the evening

###EasyEvening App
*EasyEvening is a way to create a date night, get together with friends, or entertain people that are your guests
*Our application uses the both the Zomato API and the TicketMaster API to retrieve the desired data so  our user is able to see the options of both highly rated restaurants and events going on a 25 mile radius based on the city and state they enter in the input fields

###Tools Used
Restuarant details from the Zomato API
Event details from the Ticket master API 
User validation using modals
New library was mdbootstap for design
